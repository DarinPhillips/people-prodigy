	League : 

		Refers to 2 or 3 different teams.

		Managing of Leagues?
		
			Will admin create leagues and 
			add teams to it?
			Please explain about this?
		



Clarification:
=============
		
	Members Panel:
	==============

	Driver Changes Left: 9998

	I can't access "Driver Changes Left" to see its 
	functionality.what's this about?



	Regarding Race summary:

		Will admin be entering 
		"Race Name and points Scored by each driver
		 in this race"?


	Leagues:
	========


      	The leagues would be hosted on my server for a flat rate fee 
	per season.

	How will this amount be charged??


	
	Regarding the control of user and admin.
	========================================

	Admin will have full control over races and users.

	Given:
	======

	For instance they would be able to select from a list of 	
	drivers that they would like to use. 

	They can determine how many driver changes would be allowed in 	a season.

	
	Question:
	=========

		Can users change drivers after sign up??

		I Am not clear about this.Can you send me more 	
	clarification on this?



	Estimated Time : 11 days.[excluding driver changes]
