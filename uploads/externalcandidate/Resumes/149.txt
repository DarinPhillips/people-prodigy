Modification:

Can you change the "Date Picker" so that it only displays mm/dd/yyyy and no "time" information?



Additional work :

(1 day)

As far as the  "Add Events" page goes, I realize that it is 
a very long form, therefore have broken the form into
 two separate pages....
http://www.whatparty.com/add_events.html
http://www.whatparty.com/add_events2.html
 

The customer will have to hit the "Continue" button to 
get to the next page.

One thing that is becoming very apparent to me is the requirement to 
constrain the image proportions.  Users are certainly going to 
login and because they don't know any better, they will upload
 images that are extremely large and take up the entire screen.
We will need a script that will constrain these proportions to 
fit on the screen. can you do it using GD module ??

(I have done this as 25X25) I can change this in 

admin settings if you need this to be changed.

Yes, each page does contain....
Name , Organization , Address , Phone , Events.
and yes I would like the appropriate information displayed here.
 NOTE: this information really only appears on pages 
where a customer should already be logged in.  
It doesn't appear on public "informational pages" 
(i.e... where a customer is not logged in.
